# Reference growth parameters
Since colony growth parameters (e.g. colony linear radial growth rate) depend on strain characteristic properties and agar medium composition/physical properties, reference growth parameters need to be measured with a control dataset for comparative analyses.

In the _Main_ tab, upon clicking on the button _Define reference growth parameters_, the user can define the reference radial growth rate and appearance time either by providing known values manually, or by directing ColTapp to a folder containing a control experiment monitored by time-lapse and already analyzed. In the latter case, the average colony reference appearance time and radial growth rate from that experiment will be automatically assigned. (See [Options](https://coltapp.github.io/options.html) regarding the averaging method used)

The reference radial growth rate may be used for [apperance time estimation from endpoint images](https://coltapp.github.io/endpoint.html). The reference appearance time  can be used for calibration of the raw appearance time in given experimental conditions.
