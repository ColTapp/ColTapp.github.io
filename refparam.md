# Reference growth parameters
Since colony growth parameters (e.g. colony linear radial growth rate) depend on strain characteristic properties (e.g. cell-to-cell adhesion) and agar medium composition/physical properties, reference growth parameters need to be measured with a control dataset for comparative analyses.

The user can define the reference radial growth rate and appearance time either by providing known values manually, or by directing ColTapp to a folder containing a control experiment monitored by time-lapse and already analyzed, to extract these parameters automatically. In this case, ColTapp obtains the mean of appearance time and radial growth rates of the control experimentâ€™s colonies. Users concerned by the presence of outliers in the growth control experiment may change the mean to median (or any user-defined quantile) in the [Options](https://coltapp.github.io/options.html). 

The reference radial growth rate may be used for [apperance time estimation from endpoint images](https://coltapp.github.io/endpoint.html). The reference appearance time  can be used for calibration of the raw appearance time in given experimental conditions.
