# Time-lapse

ColTapp can track the radius of detected colonies through time on time-lapse image series. First, all colonies need to be [detected]({{site.url}}/detect.html) on the latest (or a late) frame in a time-lapse series. All time-lapse associated functions are accessible through a dedicated tab on the GUI:

  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/TL0.png" alt="Time-lapse tab of GUI"/>
