# ColTapp
Are you interested in analyzing microbial colony images? [ColTapp](https://coltapp.github.io/about.html) (Colonies Time-lapse application) might be the tool you are looking for! This website is meant as a user guide. You can find further details and usage examples in the [publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72979-4) in Scientific Reports , from which many figures and explanatory snippets of this website are derived. 

We are currently working on setting up the website. Expect a finished website by the end of October 2020. Thanks for the patience!
