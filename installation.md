# Installation
There are three options for you to choose:
1. _Recommended_: You own a copy of MATLAB and can run the source code directly from MATLAB. Go to our [matlab code repo](https://github.com/ColTapp/matlab-code) and download the .m file. Load this into MATLAB and hit run.
2. _Windows_: You do not own MATLAB and want to run ColTapp on a Windows 10 computer. Go to our [Windows installer repo](https://github.com/ColTapp/win-executable) and download the executable file. Install ColTapp with it. Make sure you have the [MATLAB runtime R2020a (9.8)](https://ch.mathworks.com/de/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) installed.
3. _MacOS_: You do not own MATLAB and want to run ColTapp on a MacOS computer. Go to our [MacOS installer repo](https://github.com/ColTapp/mac-executable) and download the executable file. Install ColTapp with it. Make sure you have the [MATLAB runtime R2020a (9.8)](https://ch.mathworks.com/de/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html) installed.
