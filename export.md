# Export 

For further use in data analysis, some metrics on colonies can be exported. This is based on colonies that were already found in the program. This page descibes the export options. Most variables are exported as a three-column table, containing the frame number, the colony number and the exported data of interest, grouped with similar variables. See SI Fig. 4 from manuscript for some illustration on colonies.

## Metadata export

This option exports several analysis parameters that were used for analysis, including (when set):
- image number
- image folder
- the spatial calibration factor
- plate radius and position, or region of interest polygon vertices
- image mode (Greyscale or RGB)
- detection radius threshold
- time of data export

## Export options

Data delimiter in the CSV, export unit (¬µm / pxl) can be chosen. A subpart of the data can be exported rather than the whole data, on specific frames (images) or colonies. For this specify numbers in one of those formats:
- a list of frames/colonies spearated by commas e.g. 1,3,4,6,8 => values outside range will be ignored
- a list in the form Start:Gap:End, e.g. 2:3:13 will export 2,5,8,11.
- in the case of colonies, a list number identifier specified as a single negative value (for list identifiers, see main GUI)

## Growth parameters

Those are the calculated parameters as explained in depth in original article, when calculated:
- Appearance time is the estimated time at which colony size goes above threshold
- Growth rate is the growth rate obtained from timelapse or overlaying pictures
- Radius of a given colony at a given frame
- X and Y positions of colonies in the picture

## User lists
This option exports lists as binary values (0: not on list, 1: on list) corresponding to Userlists. This includes:
- the lists manually set by user
- the warning lists automatically generated by the program:
  . growth curve detection failure (failed Kymograph) 
  . colonies in close range to each other ("near col")
  
 ## Density metrics
 
 As described in original article for the software presentation, those are values based on colony proximity. The user can set a radius cutoff for metrics that strictly depending on distance to all colonies, so that colonies further than this radius cutoff not be taken into consideration for the calculation. 
 For example, should 4 colonies be on a plate, with 3 colonies at distance 1, 2, 4 to the focal colony, ‚àë1/D would be 1+1/2+1/4=1.75 for an infinite cutoff, while it would be 1+1/2=1.5 if the cutoff is set to be below a distance of 4. Note that this radius cutoff can be handy in crowded plates when the user know the diffusion constants of signalling molecules.
 
The angular diameter is calculated as ùê¥D = ‚àë 2*arctan(R_i / D_i), where R_i and D_i are the radius and distance from the focal colony of each neighboring colony. This metric will thus assume bigger colonies have a larger influence on focal colonies than their smaller counterparts.

The exported Voronoi area is not sensitive to the radius cutoff, but is sensitive to a proper plate border definition.
