# About ColTapp
ColTapp is an image analysis application including all steps necessary to derive various measures of bacterial colonies growing on agar plates. ColTapp can automatically detect colonies and returns their size and position as well as color, shape and spatial metrics of each colony. Additionally, time-lapse image series of the same plate can be analyzed to track the radii of colonies over time to derive linear radial growth rate and delay in growth measured by appearance time. Every measurement can be exported as .csv files for subsequent analysis.
