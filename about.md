# About ColTapp
ColTapp (Colony Time-lapse application) is a user friendly tool implementing all image- and downstream analysis steps necessary to derive biologically relevant data from pictures of bacterial colonies growing on agar plates. 
ColTapp can automatically [detect colonies](https://coltapp.github.io/detect.html) and return their size and position as well as [shape and color](https://coltapp.github.io/characteristics.html). In addition, it reports various metrics describing the [proximity of neighboring colonies](https://coltapp.github.io/characteristics.html). Users interested in monitoring colonies growth dynamics (i.e colonies appearance time and linear radial growth rate) can analyze [time-lapse imaged agar plates](https://coltapp.github.io/timelapse.html) with ColTapp. For users interested in colonies growth dynamics who have at their disposal only endpoint images from their plates (at timepoint e.g. 24h and 48h), ColTapp provides a framework to [estimate colonies appearance time and linear radial growth rate](https://coltapp.github.io/endpoint.html).
